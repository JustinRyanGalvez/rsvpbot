# How to Contribute
To contribute, just create a push request and describe what changes you are making and the purpose. 
You will need to install:
- discord.py - Main library used in this project
- python-dotenv - So that you can access the bot token via the env file

I would recommend using repl.it if you have any troubles with dependencies.
 
You will also need invite this bot to a discord server so that you can test any changes you make. You can find the invite link [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=914043981107695648&permissions=421984066624&scope=bot).
